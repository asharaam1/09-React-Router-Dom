## ðŸ“Œ What is react-router-dom?
- react-router-dom is a library that lets you handle navigation (routing) in your React web app without refreshing the page. Itâ€™s like telling React:

"Show this page when the URL is /about and show that page when itâ€™s /contact."

So instead of building separate HTML pages, you create React components as "pages" and react-router-dom switches between them.


## ðŸ§  Why use it?
- Because React is a Single Page Application (SPA)
- which means everything lives in one HTML file. So when users click around your site, you donâ€™t want full-page reloads. You want it to feel fast and smooth â€” like a real app. Thatâ€™s what react-router-dom helps with.
